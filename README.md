CalendarListview provides a easy way to select dates with a calendar for API 10+. [You can find a sample](https://github.com/traex/CalendarListview/blob/master/sample/) that show how to add DatePickerView to your layout without customization.

### Integration
The lib is available on Maven Central, you can find it with [Gradle, please](http://gradleplease.appspot.com/#calendarlistview)
``` xml

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.traex.calendarlistview:library:1.2.3'
}

```
 
### Usage
 
Declare a DayPickerView inside your layout XML file:
 
``` xml

  <com.andexert.calendarlistview.library.DayPickerView
         android:id="@+id/pickerView"
         xmlns:calendar="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
         android:layout_width="match_parent"
         android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
         
```

Next, you have to implement `DatePickerController` in your Activity or your Fragment. 
You will have to set:

- `getMinYear`: starting year 
- `getMaxYear`: final year
- `getCurrentYear`: is the current year actually displayed
- `onDayOfMonthSelected`: is called every time user selects a new date

``` java

    @Override
    public int getMinYear()
    {
        return 1970;
    }
    
    @Override
    public int getMaxYear()
    {
        return 2016;
    }

    @Override
    public int getCurrentYear()
    {
        return 2016;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onDayOfMonthSelected(int year, int month, int day)
    {
        Log.e("Day Selected", day + " / " + month + " / " + year);
    }
    
```

CalendarListview is fully customizable:

* app:colorCurrentDay [color def:#ff999999] --> The current day is always in bold but you can change its color
* app:colorSelectedDayBackground [color def:#E75F49] --> If you click on a day, a circle indicator or a rouded rectangle indicator will be draw.
* app:colorSelectedDayText [color def:#fff2f2f2] --> This is the text color of a selected day
* app:colorPreviousDay [color def:#ff999999] --> In the current month you can choose to have a specific color for the past days

* app:textSizeMonth [dimension def:16sp] --> Font size for month name
* app:textSizeDayName [dimension def:10sp] --> Font size for day name
* app:headerMonthHeight [dimension def:50dip] --> Height of month name
* app:drawRoundRect [boolean def:false] --> Draw a rounded rectangle for selected days instead of a circle
* app:selectedDayRadius [dimension def:16dip] --> Set radius if you use default circle indicator
* app:calendarHeight [dimension def:270dip] --> Height of each month/row
* app:enablePreviousDay [boolean def:true] --> Enable past days in current month
